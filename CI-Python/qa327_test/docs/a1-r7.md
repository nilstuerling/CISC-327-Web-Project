**R7 - /logout – Test Cases**

**R7.1 – Logout will invalid the current session and redirect to the login page. After logout, the user shouldn&#39;t be able to access restricted pages.**

Mocking:

- Mock backend.get\_user to return a valid\_user instance

Actions:

- open /logout (to invalid any logged-in sessions may exist)
- open /login
- enter valid\_user&#39;s email into element `#email`
- enter valid\_user&#39;s password into element `#password`
- click element `input[type=&quot;submit&quot;]`
- get redirected to home page
- open /logout (log out of current session)
- validate that the user is no longer logged in (i.e. invalidate the session)
- validate that the user is redirected to the login page
- open /
- validate that the user is not able to access /, and is redirected to the login page
- open buy ticket endpoint /buy (endpoint to be determine/implemented)
- validate that the user is not able to access buy ticket endpoint, and is redirected to the login page
- open sell ticket endpoint /sell (endpoint to be determine/implemented)
- validate that the user is not able to access sell ticket endpoint, and is redirected to the login page
- open account update endpoint /update (endpoint to be determine/implemented)
- validate that the user is not able to access update endpoint, and is redirected to the login page
- open profile endpoint (if profile endpoint is no longer /)
- validate that the user is not able to access profile endpoint, and is redirected to the login page
